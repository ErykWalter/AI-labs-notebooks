    "During the previous classes we were concerned with finding a sequence of actions (a plan) to reach one of the goal states from a predefined initial state. In a sense, we were more interested in the *journey* rather than in the *destination* itself: our goal was to transform the initial state to the goal state, not to construct the goal state from scratch. Local search is also different from tree/graph search algorithms like A*: it assumes that all intermediate states are acceptable, but they differ in their quality and the goal is to find the best solution."

    "We will reuse the definition of the class `Problem` from earlier, but extend it with a new function: `cost`, returning a number representing the cost of the state given as its argument `state`. We want to minimize the cost, so the lower the number the better the state. We make no assumptions about the cost being non-negative, i.e., there may be states with a negative cost (i.e., a gain) - such an approach enables us to consider both maximization and minimization problems within a single framework. We also replace the property `intial_state` with the funtion `random_state` which is supposed to return a randomly generated state for the problem. Finally, we remove `is_goal`, as there may be no clear goal definition."
